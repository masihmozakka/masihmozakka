 # 👋 Hi, I’m Masih Mozakka, and this is my GitHubified resume!
 
 ### :bust_in_silhouette: So, who am I?
 I'm currently a student at the Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. I study Mathematics and Energy Engineering as a double degree and I'm in the middle of my fourth year. I would say that a love of logical deductions pushed me towards maths and I also enjoy creativity and bringing my knowledge into the real world.
 
I would say that my non-technical strong suits are commitment, teamplay and good social skills. I was chairman of the student guild association in my faculty and it was there that I learned many critical skills in communication and team development. When it comes to more technical matters my strong suits are a good understanding of programming and CS in general plus a mature and tested research workflow that allows me to work on projects normally considered too complicated for my level.
 
Having visited and lived in many parts of the world I love meeting new people and being immersed in foreign cultures, my family and I lived in the beautiful country of Malaysia for a period and I have ever since reserved a special place for South East Asia in my heart. I have several years of music production under my belt and even considered a career in music during my teens, but decided that the sciences better suited my style. Chess is a hobby that I've kept on and off throughout the years, you can find me on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/plnts) and maybe we can have a game or two! My other hobbies include an interest in cooking (I make a mean fried chicken if I do say so myself) and digging around on Wikipedia.

## :nut_and_bolt: Skills

- General Software: Windows, Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel), Adobe Photoshop.

  - C: Intermediate
  - C++: intermediate
  - Python: I do most of my coding on python, I'm skilled in pure python as well as libraries including
    - Numpy: Intermediate
    - Scipy: Basic
    - Matplotlib: Intermediate
    - TensorFlow 2.0: Intermediate
    - OpenAI Gym: Basic

## :necktie: Work Experience

- I was the Teaching Assistant for a course on _Energy Conversion_ taught by Dr. Atefeh Behzadi Forough
- Chairman of the student guild association, Amirkabir University of Technology

## :briefcase: General Experiences

- Studied abroad (secondary school) at Sayfol School, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 2011-2012.
- I have organized and spoken at 3 seminars on energy related topics in my faculty:
  - Energy: From Science Fiction to Science Fact
  - On Energy and International Law
  - Transparent Solar Cells

As part of the “*Asre Energy*” series of talks, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, 2017-2019.
- Attended a seminar on _“Enabling Wind Energy in Iran”_, Amirkabir University of Technology supported by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, December-2017.
- Participant of the _“School of Mathematics Summer School on Geometric Group Theory and Topological Graph Theory”_ conducted by the IPM Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences, 2020.
- I was actively involved in student organizations and either managed or was part of the organizing team for a variaty of faculty or university wide events.

## :mag: My Research Interests
A short list will of course not do this section justice, my interests often get more niche or combine into inter-disciplinary fields. But alas, in the field of mathematics my general interests include
- Graph Theory and Applications
- Mathematical Logic
- Cryptography
- Number Theory
- Algebraic Geometry
- Group and Ring Theory
- Computer Science
- Machine Learning, AI and applications in Neuroscience

And when it comes to Energy Engineering I'm most intrigued by
- Environmental and Energy Related Policies
- Energy Conversion
- System Optimization and Smart Grids
- Renewable and Sustainable Energy Solutions
- Climate Change and Mitigation Including Large Scale Climate Modelling
- Alternative Fuels
- Energy Use of Satellites and Space Exploration


**But** that is not all! here is a special section I would like to devout to studies which concern both of my degrees, these fields combine my interests into one and excite me the most.
- Game Theory and Energy Policy: After discovering this field I have not been able to let go and have conducted extensive research in order to better educate myself.
- Computational Efficiency and Energy Use: With our ever more digitally focused world, it is important to consider (both small-scale and large-scale) how our computers use energy and strive to create better systems, either by improving the hardware or the software.


## 🌱 What am I Currently Learning?
This is a dynamic list that I will do my best to update as I get interested in new stuff or complete learning others. Right now I'm looking into
- [ ] manim
- [ ] beamer
- [ ] LaTeX package creation
- [ ] web development using django

## :notebook: University Courses I Have This Semester
- Mathematics
  - Topology
  - Geometry
  - Data Structures and Algorithms
  - Numerical Analysis I
  - Linear Algebra
- Energy Engineering
  - Industrial Design
  - Solar Energy


## 💞️ I’m Looking to Collaborate On
I'm looking to collaborate on maths papers focusing on the Melnikov valence variety problem and random graphs, plus anything having to do with the Collatz conjecture. Hit me up if you're interested! I sure am!
## 📫 How to Reach Me
Links are in my profile! I have a twitter and I hope to get my own website running if I have the time/patiance/strong enough pain killers to deal with javascript and css. Also, I have a [Telegram channel](t.me/willheeverfinishthebook) in which I write (albeit rarely) in both Persian and English.
