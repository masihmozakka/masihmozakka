 # 👋 Hi, I’m Masih Mozakka, and this is my GitHubified resume!
 
 ### :bust_in_silhouette: So, who am I?
 I'm currently a student at the Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. I study Mathematics and Energy Engineering as a double degree and I'm in the middle of my fourth year. I would say that a love of logical deductions pushed me towards maths and I also enjoy creativity and bringing my knowledge into the real world.
 
I would say that my non-technical strong suits are commitment, teamplay and good social skills. I was chairman of the student guild association in my faculty and it was there that I learned many critical skills in communication and team development. When it comes to more technical matters my strong suits are a good understanding of programming and CS in general plus a mature and tested research workflow that allows me to work on projects normally considered too complicated for my level.
 
Having visited and lived in many parts of the world I love meeting new people and being immersed in foreign cultures, my family and I lived in the beautiful country of Malaysia for a period and I have ever since reserved a special place for South East Asia in my heart. I have several years of music production under my belt and even considered a career in music during my teens, but decided that the sciences better suited my style. Chess is a hobby that I've kept on and off throughout the years, you can find me on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/plnts) and maybe we can have a game or two! My other hobbies include an interest in cooking (I make a mean fried chicken if I do say so myself) and digging around on Wikipedia.

## :nut_and_bolt: Skills

- General Software: Windows, Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel), Adobe Photoshop.

  - C: Intermediate
  - C++: intermediate
  - Python: I do most of my coding on python, I'm skilled in pure python as well as libraries including
    - Numpy: Intermediate
    - Scipy: Basic
    - Matplotlib: Intermediate
    - TensorFlow 2.0: Intermediate
    - OpenAI Gym: Basic

## :necktie: Work Experience

- I was the Teaching Assistant for a course on _Energy Conversion_ taught by Dr. Atefeh Behzadi Forough
- Chairman of the student guild association, Amirkabir University of Technology

## :briefcase: General Experiences

- Studied abroad (secondary school) at Sayfol School, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 2011-2012.
- I have organized and spoken at 3 seminars on energy related topics in my faculty:
  - Energy: From Science Fiction to Science Fact
  - On Energy and International Law
  - Transparent Solar Cells
As part of the “*Asre Energy*” series of talks, Amirkabir University of
Technology, Tehran, Iran, 2017-2019.
- Attended a seminar on _“Enabling Wind Energy in Iran”_, Amirkabir University of Technology supported by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, December-2017.
- Participant of the _“School of Mathematics Summer School on Geometric Group Theory and Topological Graph Theory”_ conducted by the IPM Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences, 2020.
- I was actively involved in student organizations and either managed or was part of the organizing team for a variaty of faculty or university wide events.

## :mag: My Research Interests
A short list will of course not do this section justice, my interests often get more niche or combine into inter-disciplinary fields. But alas, in the field of mathematics my general interests include
- Graph Theory and Applications
- Mathematical Logic
- Cryptography
- Number Theory
- Algebraic Geometry
- Group and Ring Theory
- Computer Science
- Machine Learning, AI and applications in Neuroscience

And when it comes to Energy Engineering I'm most intrigued by
- Environmental and Energy Related Policies
- Energy Conversion
- System Optimization and Smart Grids
- Renewable and Sustainable Energy Solutions
- Climate Change and Mitigation Including Large Scale Climate Modelling
- Alternative Fuels
- Energy Use of Satellites and Space Exploration


**But** that is not all! here is a special section I would like to devout to studies which concern both of my degrees, these fields combine my interests into one and excite me the most.
- Game Theory and Energy Policy: After discovering this field I have not been able to let go and have conducted extensive research in order to better educate myself.
- Computational Efficiency and Energy Use: With our ever more digitally focused world, it is important to consider (both small-scale and large-scale) how our computers use energy and strive to create better systems, either by improving the hardware or the software.


## 🌱 What am I Currently Learning?
This is a dynamic list that I will do my best to update as I get interested in new stuff or complete learning others. Right now I'm looking into
- [ ] manim
- [ ] beamer
- [ ] LaTeX package creation
- [ ] web development using django

## :notebook: University Courses I Have This Semester
- Mathematics
  - Topology
  - Geometry
  - Data Structures and Algorithms
  - Numerical Analysis I
  - Linear Algebra
- Energy Engineering
  - Industrial Design
  - Solar Energy


## 💞️ I’m Looking to Collaborate On
Nothing at the moment.
## 📫 How to Reach Me
Links are in my profile! I have a twitter and I hope to get my own website running if I have the time/patiance/strong enough pain killers to deal with javascript and css. Also, I have a [Telegram channel](t.me/willheeverfinishthebook) in which I write (albeit rarely) in both Persian and English.
